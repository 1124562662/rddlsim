# Pseudocode for Deep Reinforcement Learning in HVAC

# Import data set that contains state, action, next state
# Store data as 

# Initialize replay memory D 

# Initialize action-value function Q with random weights

# Randomly pick an initial state s0 within the range

# Do while terminated = False{
    # Exploration/Exploitation - given probability, take an action randomly or pick the action that will return
    # the maximum Q
    # If(rand() > epsilon) && action_list(s).size > 0 # if the probability decides to exploit and there is at 
    # least a record of action in the current state
        # action = the action that max Q in the current state (? how do we decide this?)
    # Else 
        # action = rand() pick a random action
